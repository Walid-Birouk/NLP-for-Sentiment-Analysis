# Predicting Toxicity in Online Comments with NLP and Transfer Learning


## Overview
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and transfer learning to identify toxic behavior in online comments. Our goal is to support the creation of healthier online environments by automatically moderating discussions and flagging toxic comments.

## Repository Contents
- **Training Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook that details the process of training the NLP model. It includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation steps.
- **Testing Notebook**: A Jupyter notebook designed for testing the model with new data. It demonstrates how to load the trained model and make predictions.
- **Datasets**: This repository includes both training and test datasets used for model development.


## Background
The rise of digital communication has unfortunately also seen an increase in toxic behavior online, including hate speech, threats, and harassment. Such behaviors disrupt healthy conversations and pose a significant challenge to community moderation efforts.

## Objectives
- To understand the nature and nuances of online conversations.
- To preprocess and prepare textual data for machine learning analysis.
- To train an NLP model with transfer learning to classify comments based on their toxicity levels.
- To evaluate the model's performance and its applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
We utilize a dataset containing online comments, which we preprocess and prepare for analysis. This involves cleaning the text, tokenizing sentences, and formatting the data to be suitable for model training.

## Model Development
The project employs transfer learning and NLP techniques to develop a model capable of identifying toxic comments. This approach allows us to leverage pre-trained models, significantly reducing the need for extensive computational resources and large datasets.

## Results and Conclusion
The developed model demonstrates promising results in predicting the toxicity of online comments. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of NLP and transfer learning in tackling challenges related to digital communication.

## Future Work
Continuing to refine the model and incorporating more nuanced understanding of language can further improve its accuracy and applicability. Additionally, expanding the dataset and including more diverse forms of online interactions can enhance the model's robustness.

## How to Use
Instructions for setting up the project, training the model, and using it to predict comment toxicity can be found in the notebooks.
